# Nursery-Horrors
A school project completed in 2023 for IST. The task was to make a website about 3 nursery rhymes, including a landing page, content pages, etc. This is the first proper html/css website I have made. 
This website is currently a bit buggy, as the videos don't seem to be loading, and some of the text is off-center. This will not be patched anytime soon. 
I did not make the videos, my partner did them (they did not do anything else). Got 90% for this.
